abstract = {A new database of volcanic fatalities is presented and analysed, covering the period 1600 to 2010 AD. Data are from four sources: the Smithsonian Institution, Witham (2005), CRED EM-DAT and Munich RE. The data were combined and formatted, with a weighted average fatality figure used where more than one source reports an event; the former two databases were weighted twice as strongly as the latter two. More fatal incidents are contained within our database than similar previous works; approximately 46{\%} of the fatal incidents are listed in only one of the four sources, and fewer than 10{\%} are in all four. 278,880 fatalities are recorded in the database, resultant from 533 fatal incidents. The fatality count is dominated by a handful of disasters, though the majority of fatal incidents have caused fewer than ten fatalities. Number and empirical probability of fatalities are broadly correlated with VEI, but are more strongly influenced by population density around volcanoes and the occurrence and extent of lahars (mudflows) and pyroclastic density currents, which have caused 50{\%} of fatalities. Indonesia, the Philippines, and the West Indies dominate the spatial distribution of fatalities, and there is some negative correlation between regional development and number of fatalities. With the largest disasters removed, over 90{\%} of fatalities occurred between 5 km and 30 km from volcanoes, though the most devastating eruptions impacted far beyond these distances. A new measure, the Volcano Fatality Index, is defined to explore temporal changes in societal vulnerability to volcanic hazards. The measure incorporates population growth and recording improvements with the fatality data, and shows prima facie evidence that vulnerability to volcanic hazards has fallen during the last two centuries. Results and interpretations are limited in scope by the underlying fatalities data, which are affected by under-recording, uncertainty, and bias. Attempts have been made to estimate the extent of these issues, and to remove their effects where possible. The data analysed here are provided as supplementary material. An updated version of the Smithsonian fatality database fully integrated with this database will be publicly available in the near future and subsequently incorporate new data.},

abstract = {The entrainment of air into pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) impacts the dynamics and thermal history of these highly mobile currents. However, direct measurement of entrainment in PDCs is hampered due to hazardous conditions and opaqueness of these flows. We combine three-dimensional multiphase Eulerian-Eulerian-Lagrangian calculations with proxies of thermal conditions preserved in deposits to quantify air entrainment in PDCs at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador. We conclude that small-volume PDCs develop a particle concentration gradient that results in disparate thermal characteristics for the concentrated bed load ({\textgreater}600 to {\~{}}800 K) and the overlying dilute suspended load ({\~{}}300–600 K). The dilute suspended load has effective entrainment coefficients 2–3 times larger than the bed load. This investigation reveals a dichotomy in entrainment and thermal history between two regions in the current and provides a mechanism to interpret the depositional thermal characteristics of small-volume but frequently occurring PDCs.},

abstract = {a r t i c l e i n f o Our ability to interpret the deposits of pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) is critical for understanding the transport and depositional processes that control PDC dynamics. This paper focuses on the influence of slope on flow dynamics and criticality as recorded in PDC deposits from the 18 May 1980 eruption of Mt. St. Helens (USA). PDC deposits are found along the steep flanks (10°-30°) and across the pumice plain ({\~{}}5°) up to 8 km north of the volcano. Granulometry, componentry and descriptions of depositional characteristics (e.g., bedform morphology) are recorded with distance from source. The pumice plain deposits are primarily thick (3-12 m), massive and poorly-sorted, and represent deposition from a series of concentrated PDCs. By contrast, the steep flank deposits are stratified to cross-stratified, suggesting deposition from PDCs where turbulence strongly influenced transport and depositional processes. We propose that acceleration of the concentrated PDCs along the steep flanks resulted in thinning of the concentrated, basal region of the current(s). Enhanced entrainment of ambient air, and autofluidization from upward fluxes of air from substrate interstices and plunging breakers across rugged , irregular topography further inflated the currents to the point that the overriding turbulent region strongly influenced transport and depositional mechanisms. Acceleration in combination with partial confinement in slot canyons and high surface roughness would also increase basal shear stress, further promoting shear and traction transport in the basal region of the current. Conditions along the steep flank resulted in supercritical flow, as recorded by regressive bedforms, which gradually transitioned to subcritical flow downstream as the concentrated basal region thickness increased as a function of decreasing slope and flow energy. We also find that (1) PDCs were erosive into the underlying granular substrate along high slopes (N 25°) where currents were partially confined in steep slot canyons, suggesting that basal shear stress is an important control on erosive capacity, and (2) bedform amplitude, wavelength and the presence of regressive bedforms increase with increasing slope and proximity to source along the steep flank, suggesting a link between bedform morphology, flow velocity, and flow criticality. While our results indicate that slope and irregular topography strongly influence PDC dynamics , criticality and erosive capacity, the influence of these conditions on ultimate flow runout distance is unclear. The work here also highlights the issue that relationships between the controls on bedform size and morphology in density stratified flows remain poorly constrained, limiting our ability to extract important information about the currents that produced them. These final two points warrant further exploration through the combination of field, experimental and numerical approaches.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2018. American Geophysical Union. Pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) are a significant volcanic hazard. However, their dominant transport mechanisms remain poorly understood, in part because of the large variability of PDC types and deposits. Here we combine field data with experimental and numerical simulations to illuminate the twofold fate of particles settling from an ash cloud to form the dense PDC basal flow. At solid fractions  {\textgreater} 1 vol {\%}, heterogeneous drag leads to formation of mesoscale particle clusters that favor rapid particle settling and result in a mobile dense layer with significant bed weight support. Conversely, at lower concentrations the absence of particle clusters typically leads to formation of poorly mobile dense beds that deposit massive layers. Based on this transport dichotomy, we present a numerical dense-dilute parameter that allows a PDC's dominant transport mechanism to be determined directly from the deposit geometry and grainsize characteristics.},

abstract = {The 2010 pyroclastic density currents (PDC) at Merapi have presented a rare opportunity to collect a uniquely detailed dataset of the source, extent, lateral variations and impact of various PDC deposits on a densely populated area. Using traditional volcanological field-based methods and a multi-temporal dataset of high-resolution satellite imagery, a total of 23 PDC events have been recognized, including 5 main channeled flows, 15 overbank flows derived from overspill and re-channelization of the main PDCs into adjacent tributaries and two main surge events. The 2010 PDC deposits covered an area of {\~{}}22.3km2, unequally distributed between valley-filling (6.9{\%}), overbank (22.4{\%}) and surge and associated fallout deposits (71.7{\%}). Their total estimated non-DRE volume is {\~{}}36.3×106m3, with 50.2{\%} of this volume accounting for valley-filling deposits, 39.3{\%} for overbank deposits and 10.5{\%} for surge and associated fallout deposits. More than 70{\%} of the total volume was deposited during the third eruptive phase (4–5 November), and only 16.6{\%}, 11.5{\%} and 0.9{\%} during the first (26–29 October), second (30 October – 3 November) and fourth phase (6–23 November), respectively. The internal architecture and lithofacies variations of the 2010 PDC deposits were investigated using data collected from 30 stratigraphic sections measured after one rainy season of erosion. The results show that complex, local-scale variations in flow dynamics and deposit architectures are apparent and that the major factors controlling the propagation of the main flows and their potential hazards for overbanking were driven by: (1) the rapid emplacement of several voluminous PDCs, associated with the steady infilling of the receiving landscape after the two first phases of the eruption; (2) longitudinal changes in channel capacity following increased sinuosity in the valley and decreased containment space; and (3) the effects of varying source mechanisms (gravitational dome collapse, vertical or lateral dome explosions and column-collapse) and source materials involved during individual PDC-forming events. Integration of these data into numerical simulations of the channeled and overbank PDCs of the third eruptive phase (4–5 November) using two well-established geophysical mass flow models, Titan2D and VolcFlow, allow us to evaluate the ability of these models to reproduce the main features of the natural deposits and some of the flow overbanking processes observed in the field. Using such a multi-technique approach, the dataset obtained in this study not only characterizes the PDCs and related hazards at Merapi, but will allow comparisons with similar events at other volcanoes around the globe.},

abstract = {Pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) vary between two end members, concentrated and dilute. When a PDC interacts with an uneven topography, the flow field variables (velocity, pressure, bulk density, particle concentration) may drastically change near the flow–substrate boundary. These changes may significantly affect the sediment flux and the resulting deposits can record the effects in their facies architecture. Here we show, by means of numerical simulations, how a dilute pyroclastic density current interacts with four different types of simple topography, namely: flat, one hill, one valley and two hills. Our numerical scheme treats the very fine particles as being in full thermo-mechanical equilibrium with the volcanic gas, i.e. a dusty gas. A dusty gas–air mixture is defined as a mixture of dusty gas and atmospheric air. The trajectories of the coarser particles or discrete phase (three grain-size classes of 1mm, 5mm and 10mm and density of 1500kg/m3) are tracked as Lagrangian particles that interact with the dusty gas–air mixture through two-way momentum and energy coupling. Numerical results are used to analyze the local effects of topography on the deposition of the Lagrangian particles, by monitoring with time and space the local changes at the boundary between the current and the substrate. The results show that the sediment flux in the flow boundary zone increases near the stoss sides of hills and in the valleys, relative to the flat reference case, whereas it decreases along the lee flanks and on top of the hills. We use the sediment flux in the flow boundary zone and the grain-size distribution of the Lagrangian particles as proxies of the deposit features, and by these parameters we qualitatively compare simulations with deposits of known eruptions.},

abstract = {The development of particle-enriched regions (bed-load) at the base of particle-laden gravity currents has been widely observed, yet the controls and relative partitioning of material into the bed-load is poorly understood. We examine particle-laden gravity currents whose initial mixture (particle and fluid) density is greater than the ambient fluid, but whose interstitial fluid density is less than the ambient fluid (such as occurs in pyroclastic flows produced during volcanic eruptions or when sediment-enriched river discharge enters the ocean, generating hyperpycnal turbidity currents). A multifluid numerical approach is employed to assess suspended load and bed-load transport in particle-laden gravity currents under varying boundary conditions. Particle-laden flows that traverse denser fluid (such as pyroclastic flows crossing water) have leaky boundaries that provide the conceptual framework to study suspended load in isolation from bed-load transport. We develop leaky and saltation boundary conditions to study the influence of flow substrate on the development of bed-load. Flows with saltating boundaries develop particle-enriched basal layers (bed-load) where momentum transfer is primarily a result of particle-particle collisions. The grain size distribution is more homogeneous in the bed-load and the saltation boundaries increase the run-out distance and residence time of particles in the flow by as much as 25{\%} over leaky boundary conditions. Transport over a leaky substrate removes particles that reach the bottom boundary and only the suspended load remains. Particle transport to the boundary is proportional to the settling velocity of particles, and flow dilution results in shear and buoyancy instabilities at the upper interface of these flows. These instabilities entrain ambient fluid, and the continued dilution ultimately results in these currents becoming less dense than the ambient fluid. A unifying concept is energy dissipation due to particle-boundary interaction: leaky boundaries dissipate energy more efficiently at the boundary than their saltating counterparts and have smaller run-out distance.

abstract = {The explosive eruption of voluminous silicic magmas often produces widespread and massive deposits formed from pyroclastic density currents. While these punctuated events dramatically alter the landscape and have potential climate-altering impact, our understanding of the internal structure and transport dynamics of these eruptions is hampered by a lack of direct observations. We utilize the natural boundary conditions encountered by the eruption of the Kos Plateau Tuff to probe its internal structure as well as constrain the neotectonic activity in the region and eruption duration of this moderate to large ({\textgreater}60 km3) event. At the time of the eruption, 161 ka, the lower sea level in the Mediterranean may have resulted in flows that traversed mostly land to the north of the eruptive vent, while flows to the south may have encountered an expanse of water. Steep topography and overwater transport can impede the transport of the dense basal portions of the flow where particles make multiple or sustained contact with the bed. We use an Eulerian-Eulerian-Lagrangian computational approach coupled with overwater and overland boundary conditions, including topography, to determine the role of bed load versus suspended load in the transport of these flows. We find that a ring vent structure and eruptive fluxes greater than ∼2 × 106 m3/s are required for the spatial distribution of the KPT. The maximum grain size and deposit locations of the first voluminous ignimbrite unit (D) can be explained by suspended flow to the south, consistent with overwater transport, and bed load and suspended load transport to the north, consistent with overland transport. However, the maximum lithic size for the largest and last ignimbrite unit (E) requires some bed load transport in all directions. We propose that the boundary conditions were significantly altered during the course of the eruption, through either the in-filling of a shallow sea to the south or the development of a thick pumice raft to aid saltation. On the basis of the inferred eruptive flux, we estimate that the duration of the eruption climax, in which most of the material was erupted, likely only lasted from a few hours to a day.},

abstract = {[1] One of the more distinctive features of many ignimbrites is the presence of large lithics (some greater than meter scale) and pumices that have been transported great distances ({\textgreater}10 km) from the eruptive vent, sometimes over steep terrain and expanses of water. In many cases, these particles have been transported much further than can be explained by aerodynamic forces and ballistic trajectories. We examine the forces responsible for transport of large clasts and examine in detail the momentum transfer occurring when particles interact with their boundaries. We performed a suite of experiments and numerical simulations to quantify the mass and momentum transfer that occurs when particles interact with a pumice bed substrate and with water substrate, two geologically motivated flow end-members. We find that clasts transported in dilute currents are particularly sensitive to the nature of the boundary, and while large particles can skip several times on a water substrate, they travel less far than particles that impact pumice bed substrates. All else being equal, large particles in dense pyroclastic density currents are themselves relatively insensitive to the details of their boundaries; however, one of the most important ways boundary conditions influence large particles is not through direct interaction but by changing the local concentration of fine particles. Momentum transfer from fine particles to large particles appears to be required to transport large clasts great distances. If initially dense flows become dilute during transport, then the transport capacity of large particles in the flow is substantially decreased. Citation: Dufek, J., J. Wexler, and M.

abstract = {Gravitational settling of fragments, gas elutriation and boundary layer processes cause concentration values to change within different parts of sediment gravity flows during movement. These processes result in flow transformations, density stratification and decoupling of single currents into separate sediment gravity flows. Density can change by an increase in solids concentration in basal zones of currents by downward fall of particles, or by incorporation of particles from the substrate, thereby leaving their upper parts more dilute. In some flows, upward-streaming gases and elutriation of fines cause dilute turbulent currents to develop at the top of a dense current. Increasing concentration dampens turbulent action, transforming the turbulent to the nonturbulent state, commonly at the current's base. Conversely, dilute parts of currents become or remain turbulent. Currents consisting of turbulent and nonturbulent parts can decouple by shearing past one another because of differing flow properties, with each part taking separate paths. The manner by which a pyroclastic flow moves affects its predicted runout distance, its distribution as continuous sheets or in isolated basins, and whether it can cross barriers such as high mountain ranges or water bodies. During the eruption of Unzen volcano on June 3, 1991, decoupling of a pyroclastic surge from the top of a pyroclastic flow caused the deaths of Harry Glicken, Maurice Krafft, Katia Krafft and 40 Japanese citizens. Mapping volcanic hazard zones requires that consideration be given to decoupling processes to help prevent similar tragedies in the future.},

abstract = {Pyroclastic surges are low-concentration turbulent flows that form in at least three ways: (1) eruption column collapse (ground surge, base surge), (2) elutriation from the top of a moving pyroclastic flow (ash cloud), and (3) directly from a crater without an accompanying vertical eruption column.* * Note added in proof: During the April 17, 1979, eruption of Soufriere, St. Vincent, nu{\'{e}}es ardentes were observed to form simultaneously with (and without collapse of) a strong vertical eruption column that attained an altitude of about 20,000 m (Richard Fiske, personal communication). Ground surge deposits occur at the base and ash cloud deposits occur at the top of pyroclastic flow sequences. Ground surges and ash clouds may move independently of their associated pyroclastic flow, and, like flows directly from a crater, their deposits may occur alone or within any part of pyroclastic flow sequence. The presence or absence of surge layers, their position with respect to pyroclastic flow deposits and their physical characteristics have significance with respect to the characteristics or eruption columns and flowage mechanisms of pyroclastic flows. {\textcopyright} 1979.},

abstract = {An 11-minute sequence of laterally-directed explosions and retrogressive collapses on 5 November 2010 at Merapi (Indonesia) destroyed a rapidly-growing dome and generated high-energy pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) spreading over 22km2 with a runout of 8.4km while contemporaneous co-genetic valley-confined PDCs reached 15.5km. This event formed Stage 4 of the multi-stage 2010 eruption, the most intense eruptive episode at Merapi since 1872. The deposits and the widespread devastating impact of associated high-energy PDCs on trees and buildings show striking similarities with those from historical volcanic blasts (Montagne Pel{\'{e}}e, Martinique, Bezymianny, Russia, Mount St. Helens, USA, Soufri{\`{e}}re Hills, Montserrat). We provide data from stratigraphic and sedimentologic analyses of 62 sections of the first unequivocal blast-like deposits in Merapi's recent history. We used high resolution satellite imagery to map eruptive units and flow direction from the pattern of extensive tree blowdown. The stratigraphy of Stage 4 consists of three depositional units (U0, U1, U2) that we correlate to the second, third and fourth explosions of the seismic record. Both U1 and U2 show a bi-partite layer stratigraphy consisting each of a lower L1 layer and an upper L2 layer. The lower L1 layer is typically very coarse-grained, fines-poor, poorly-sorted and massive, and was deposited by the erosive waxing flow head. The overlying L2 layer is much finer grained, fines-rich, moderately to well-sorted, with laminar to wavy stratification. L2 was deposited from the waning upper part and wake of the PDC. Field observations indicate that PDC height reached {\~{}}330m with an internal velocity of {\~{}}100ms−1 within 3km from the source. The summit's geometry and the terrain morphology formed by a major transversal ridge and a funneling deep canyon strongly focused PDC mass towards a major constriction, thereby limiting the loss of kinetic energy. This favored elevated PDC velocities and high particle concentration, promoted overspilling of PDCs across high ridges into other river valleys, and generated significant dynamic pressures to distances of 6km that caused total destruction of buildings and the forest. The Merapi 2010 eruption highlights that explosive and gravitational disintegration of a rapidly growing dome can generate devastating high-energy, high-velocity PDCs. This constitutes a credible high impact scenario for future multi-stage eruptions at Merapi and at other volcanoes that pose particular monitoring, crisis response, and risk reduction challenges.},

abstract = {We herein report an example of pyro clastic density current avulsion on 14 June 2006 at Merapi, Indonesia. Four discrete series of multiple dome collapses led to the generation of four individual block-and-ash flows into Kali Gendol valley. All four pyroclastic density currents locally overflowed the channel margins to devastate cultivated terraces along each side of the box-shaped canyon while propagating as much as 2.2 km within adjacent tributaries. The largest destruction was caused by the second and third pyroclastic density currents. Both of these flows partially spilled out of the Gendol valley at a travel distance of 4.9 km, bypassing a sabo dam just upstream of the village of Kaliadem and leaving the village almost completely destroyed and buried by several meters of overbank deposits. The main mechanism of flow avulsion on June 14 was the overflow of up to 20 vol{\%} of the dense, basal part of the pyroclastic density currents onto interfluves. The relative proportions of valley-escaped material increased dramatically in the succession of each of the four pyroclastic density currents. The main geometric parameters controlling flow avulsion and their critical values were quantified through high-resolution real-time kinetic-global positioning system (RTKGPS) data of the pre-event topography for each of the 14 June flows. This case highlights the way in which a sabo dam can significantly increase the potential of flow avulsion. Key lessons are derived for the future hazard mitigation in valleys subject to volcanic mass flows. Flow-observational and geometric data are combined into a model to derive the kinematic characteristics of the basal, valley-ponding avalanche and the valley-escaping veneer flows, which are otherwise hidden by overriding clouds of elutriated ash.},

abstract = {Deposits of pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) often contain accidental lithic clasts of typical size of 0.1-1 m captured from an underlying substrate by the parent flows at distances up to several tens of kilometers from the eruptive vent. In order to gain insights into the nature of PDCs, this study investigates the conditions required for entrainment of particles from a granular substrate by a gas-particle density current, with special emphasis to ignimbrite-forming currents whose dynamics are controversial. The two types of physics of emplacement of PDCs proposed in literature are considered. The first model deals with a hydraulically rough, dilute turbulent PDC of bulk density of {\~{}}1-10 kg/m3and considers that entrainment through both traction and saltation is controlled by a Shield criterion at high ({\textgreater}104) particle Reynolds number. The second model considers entrainment by a PDC consisting of a dense basal flow of bulk density of the order of 103kg/m3and with high interstitial gas pore pressure. This model involves uplift of substrate particles, caused by an upward pressure gradient at the flow-substrate interface, and then transport and deposition on the aggrading basal deposit of the flow as demonstrated by recent laboratory experiments. Results show that a dilute PDC can entrain blocks of maximum size of {\~{}}10-15 cm (for a block density of 2000-3000 kg/m3) if maximum current velocities up to {\~{}}100 m/s are taken into account. This, in turn, suggests that larger (heavier) blocks found in deposits were captured by PDCs if these had a dense basal flow. The dense flow model predicts that PDCs have the potential to entrain metric blocks, whose maximum size (up to {\~{}}2-5 m) decreases with decreasing atmospheric pressure (i.e. increasing altitude). Application of the model considering published data on the characteristics of accidental blocks in several well-studied ignimbrites indicates that the velocity of the parent dense PDCs was up to {\~{}}25-30 m/s.},

abstract = {A series of experiments was carried out to review the process of fluidization for a number of particulate materials having various sorting and grain shape characteristics. The up (increasing gas velocity) curve on a gas velocity/bed-pressure drop plot for a poorly sorted mixture of irregularly shaped particles is divided into three sections; non-expanded, expanded, and segregating. These sections are used to define a threefold genetic classification of pyroclastic flows which can be directly linked to conditions within a semifluidized parent flow. Type 1 flows are ungraded and mostly result from hot-avalanche flows and pyroclastic flows formed of relatively dense material. Type 2 and type 3 flows are mainly pumiceous ignimbrites and are distinguished by expansion induced coarse-tail grading, coupled with segregation structures in the latter. The implications of this classification are discussed with reference to the flow regimes, deposition slope angles, crystal concentration and “fossil fumaroles” variously developed in the flows. The relevance of the source of fluidizing gas is discussed in relation to the zoning of flow types within a single flow unit and it is shown how this, and its attendant structures, can be used to estimate the relative importance of each gas source during and after flow emplacement.},
