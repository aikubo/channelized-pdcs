Research Project Abstract

Around explosive volcanic centers such as Mount Merapi, pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) pose a great risk to life and property. Understanding of the mobility and dynamics of PDCs and other gravity currents is vital to mitigating hazards of future eruptions. Evidence from volcaniclastic deposits and one-dimensional modeling suggest that channelization of flows effectively increases run out distances (Bursik & Wood, 1996; Brand et al., 2014). Dense flows are thought to scour and erode the bed leading to confinement for subsequent flows and could result in significant changes to predicted runout distance and mobility. My proposed project will the results of three-dimensional multiphase models comparing confined and unconfined flows using simplified geometries using the methods outlined in Dufek & Bergantz (2007). We will explore how confinement geometries impacts the particle concentration gradient, gas entrainment, and dynamic pressure. In channelized flows, there is significantly less entrainment and higher velocities compared to unconfined flows. We will also investigate sinuous channels and the conditions necessary for channel avulsion and possible mechanisms for overwhelming terrain.
